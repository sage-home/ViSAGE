## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.2] — 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **FITS catalogue export failed on the units note.** The exported metadata
  carries a note that contained an em dash, and FITS headers only accept
  printable ASCII, so every FITS export aborted with `FITS header values must
  contain standard printable ASCII characters`. Header keywords, header values
  and column units are now coerced to ASCII on the way out: common Unicode
  punctuation is mapped to its ASCII equivalent (dashes, quotes, `°`, `µ`,
  `×`), accents are stripped, and anything left outside printable ASCII
  becomes `?`. This also covers non-ASCII coming in from output paths and
  `.par` file entries. CSV, TXT and HDF5 exports are unchanged.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added

- **HDF5 merger trees (`TreeType lhalo_hdf5`) are now read.** Boxes whose trees
  are HDF5 — The300 among them — previously showed no haloes at all, because
  the reader only understood the packed lhalo_binary struct and silently
  parsed the HDF5 header bytes as halo counts. The format is now detected from
  the file itself (no new configuration), and `TreeName.N.hdf5` is found as
  well as a bare `TreeName.N`. Field names are resolved by alias, since these
  files use the Illustris/LHaloTree spelling rather than the struct's:
  `SubhaloPos`, `SubhaloVMax`, `FirstHaloInFOFGroup`, and — for the mass —
  whichever `Group_M_*` column is populated (see below). Positions stored in
  kpc/h are converted to Mpc/h, detected by comparing against `BoxSize`.
  Verified against SAGE's own output for The300 at z=0: 79,890 host haloes,
  matching its `Type == 0` count exactly, with identical masses and positions.
- **A tree file that can't be found now says so**, instead of reporting
  `none found above mass cut` as though the mass floor had filtered
  everything out.

### Fixed

- **Haloes came back empty on tree files that don't carry the mass in `Mvir`.**
  Tree sets disagree on which column holds the halo mass, so ViSAGE now tries
  several and takes the first that is actually populated — `Mvir`, `M_TopHat`,
  `M_Mean200` for lhalo_binary; those plus `Group_M_Crit200` /
  `Group_M_TopHat200` / `Group_M_Mean200` and other common spellings for
  lhalo_hdf5 (SAGE itself maps `Group_M_Crit200` onto `Mvir`). Columns that
  are present but all zero are skipped. Preference order is strict, so trees
  that do populate `Mvir` are read exactly as before, and `Rvir`/`Vvir`, the
  mass cut, colouring and filtering all follow the chosen column. The load
  line names the column when it isn't `Mvir`.
- **Only FOF centrals are rendered as host haloes on HDF5 trees.** Their mass
  columns are populated for satellites too, so — unlike lhalo_binary, where
  satellites carry `Mvir = 0` and the mass floor excludes them — centrals are
  now selected explicitly via `FirstHaloInFOFGroup`.

### Performance

- **HDF5 tree files are scanned once, not once per snapshot.** h5py serialises
  the per-tree reads and parallelising doesn't help (threads gained nothing,
  processes were ~4× slower), so a naive per-snapshot read of The300's 152k
  trees would have cost ~65 s × 129 snapshots. Each file is now indexed once
  into memory (~40 s for 5.5M host haloes across 118 snapshots) and every
  snapshot is served from that index in milliseconds, so preloading the whole
  run costs no further I/O. The build is locked per file, so the snapshot
  loader's threads share one scan rather than duplicating it.

## [2.2.2] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Haloes came back empty on tree files that don't carry the mass in `Mvir`.**
  The lhalo_binary struct has three mass columns (`Mvir`, `M_TopHat`,
  `M_Mean200`) and tree sets from different simulations / converters populate
  different ones; ViSAGE only ever read `Mvir`, so trees that leave it at zero
  rendered no haloes at all (`Haloes: none found above mass cut`). The reader
  now takes the mass from the first of those columns that is actually
  populated, per tree file and snapshot, and says which one it used when it
  isn't `Mvir`. Preference order is strict, so trees that do populate `Mvir`
  are read exactly as before — and Rvir/Vvir, the mass cut, colouring and
  filtering all follow the chosen column.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **SED synthesis failed on lightcones whose scale-factor list is a relative
  path** (e.g. microUchuu's `input/microuchuu/trees/Uchuu100_scalefactor.txt`).
  The stage read `FileWithSnapList` from the lightcone header, which SAGE
  stores relative to its *own* run directory — so it didn't resolve from where
  the SED step runs and the pipeline aborted with a `FileNotFoundError`. The
  run script now passes the absolute `ALIST_FILE` to the SED stage via a new
  `--alist` flag; relative header paths are also resolved against the lightcone
  file's own directory as a fallback, and the error message now says to pass
  `--alist`. Existing cached `run_lightcone.sh` scripts are auto-upgraded on
  load to include the flag (band and dust/metallicity choices preserved).

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Synthetic Photometry (SED) is now a false-colour image builder on its
  own layer.** In Lightcone Mode the **Box** tab is replaced by a
  **Photometry** tab driving a completely separate galaxy-splat layer with
  its own **Visible** / **Opacity** — so photometry can be shown with the
  galaxies on, off, or on its own (turn the galaxies off and view the
  photometry alone). It's hidden by default. When shown it paints a **stack**
  of the ticked filters into a proper astronomical false-colour composite
  (à la Lupton et al. 2004): each filter is tinted a representative colour
  (u/UV → violet, g → green, r/i/z & JHK/WISE → deepening reds, …), and the
  per-galaxy channel *ratios* carry the real SED shape (median-balanced,
  contrast-boosted) so galaxies come out visibly blue / red / yellow by their
  actual colours, with an asinh brightness stretch — rather than washing to
  a flat white. It's a mock multi-band image, drawn as nested gaussian shells
  (a small near-opaque core inside fainter haloes) so the splats read as
  crisp, defined points. Each splat's alpha is its own brightness, so faint
  galaxies are transparent rather than opaque dark disks — no dark spots
  where a dim foreground galaxy overlaps brighter ones behind it.
  Filters are multi-select (ticks show the stack) and mass-to-light (`M*/L`)
  entries stack alongside them; a colour-swatch legend shows the active
  stack. Switching photometry on hides the normal galaxies by default (and
  switching it off brings them back) so the image reads cleanly; re-enable
  the galaxies to overlay both.
- **Load Existing Lightcone.** The LightSAGE wizard's scan step offers a
  **Load Existing Lightcone** button that lists any `cli_lightcone` `.h5`
  files already in `sage_outputs/lightcone/` (or the legacy
  `~/.visage/lightcone_output/`, or recent session models) and opens the
  chosen one straight into Lightcone Mode — no clone/build/run needed.
- **SED synthesis: metallicity + dust options.** The LightSAGE run-script
  SED stage gains checkboxes: **metallicity** (on by default — uses each
  galaxy's own mass-weighted stellar Z = `MetalsStellarMass/StellarMass`,
  binned; uncheck to force solar for everyone), **dust** (off by default — a
  Calzetti starburst attenuation of configurable V-band optical depth
  `SED_DUST2`, which reddens the galaxies), and **dust emission** (off; when
  dust is on, re-emits the absorbed energy in the IR via Draine & Li 2007, so
  the mid-IR WISE bands become physical rather than caveated). All are also
  exposed on the `visage-sed` CLI (`--no-metallicity`, `--dust`, `--dust2`,
  `--dust-emission`).
- **Catalogue export supports lightcones.** Export now reads a flat
  `cli_lightcone` file directly (no `Snap_N` group) — so its columns,
  including any synthetic-photometry `mag_rest_*` / `mag_obs_*` datasets,
  come through — and a **Whole Lightcone** scope (the default in Lightcone
  Mode) exports every galaxy in the cone.

### Changed

- **Lightcone camera framing.** Reset / default view now zooms in on the
  cone (filling the viewport width rather than fitting the bounding sphere
  to the shorter axis, which left it a tiny sliver), kept horizontal and
  centred end to end. The **go-to-centre** button in Lightcone Mode now
  stands at the observer (coordinate origin) looking outward along the
  cone, sky spread horizontally, instead of using box-centre math.
- **Colourbar limit labels lightened** in the Structure panel (`#6b7280` →
  `#a3adbb`) so the min/max values are legible.
- **Lightcone flythrough — gentler first zoom.** The first move (from the
  whole-cone framing into the nearest group) is now distance-scaled to fly
  at the same linear speed as Box Mode's approach, instead of swooping the
  much larger distance in the same fixed time.

### Fixed

- **Lightcone galaxies popped in and out when rotating/panning from the
  observer view.** The go-to-observer camera parked its focal point ~1 Mpc
  from the eye, so VTK's clipping-range heuristic (which scales with the
  focal distance) collapsed the near plane and clipped the deep cone as the
  camera moved. The focal point now sits at the cone centre, so the whole
  cone stays rendered while you orbit or pan.
- **Photometry is fully decoupled from the Galaxies section.** It's now its
  own layer with its own controls, so nothing about it touches (or is touched
  by) the galaxy colour-by / colormap.
- **`./bin/visage` could silently run a pip-installed copy instead of the
  checkout.** The launcher used `python -m visage.cli`, which resolves
  `visage` against the current directory — so launching from anywhere other
  than the repo root picked up an installed `sage-viewer` in site-packages,
  making local code edits appear to do nothing. It now prepends the repo
  root to `PYTHONPATH` (so the checkout always wins) and prints a one-line
  banner showing which `visage` file and version is actually running.

## [2.1.3] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Session Models could show entries pointing at files that no longer
  exist**, with no way to tell why or where they came from — every launch
  ever recorded a path into `~/.visage/session_models.json` and nothing
  ever pruned it. Loading the registry now drops any entry whose file is
  gone (and persists that cleanup); the dropdown also shows each entry's
  containing folder as its subtitle (full path on hover), so two entries
  with the same name/kind — e.g. two lightcones — are distinguishable.

### Fixed

- **SED Structure-panel section was showing colour indices/mass-to-light as
  dropdown options that silently did nothing, and the "Colour by band"
  picker displayed the general dropdown's current mode (e.g. "structure")
  as if it were selected.** Both were wiring bugs from the previous
  release: the colour-index/mass-to-light list-building helper was written
  but never actually called, and the picker shared its `v_model` with the
  general "Colour by" dropdown instead of its own dedicated state. The
  picker now has its own state (clearing back to a placeholder whenever a
  non-SED mode is active elsewhere), and colour-index/M\*/L modes get their
  intended default colormap (diverging `coolwarm` / mass-like `cividis`)
  and computed colorbar range, not the generic fallback.

- **A `run_lightcone.sh` saved by an older ViSAGE version never gained new
  wizard features.** Since a saved script was loaded verbatim, one saved
  before the per-band checkbox refactor kept its old single `SED_BANDS`
  text field forever — the new 14-checkbox grid simply never appeared,
  even after upgrading ViSAGE. Loading a script now detects an outdated
  structure and regenerates it from the current template, carrying every
  customizable value forward (paths, ra/dec/z, SED settings) and mapping
  the old space-separated band list onto the matching new checkboxes.

### Changed

- **All 14 SED filter-band checkboxes are checked by default** in the
  LightSAGE run script (previously WISE W1-4 defaulted off); uncheck any
  you don't want. `visage.sed.filters.DEFAULT_BANDS` (used by the
  standalone `visage-sed` CLI) matches. WISE's mid-IR flux is still
  dominated by dust emission this pipeline doesn't model — that caveat
  applies regardless of the checkbox default.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Stale `LIGHTCONE_DIR` in a saved `run_lightcone.sh`.** A previously-saved
  run script could reference a LightSAGE checkout that no longer exists —
  moved, deleted, or cloned under an older ViSAGE version's folder-naming
  convention (`sage-lightcone` vs `LightSAGE`) — failing stage 1 outright
  with "No such file or directory". `LIGHTCONE_DIR` is now always resynced
  to whatever the current session's scan actually found and verified when
  loading a saved script, while every genuine user preference in it (ra/dec/z
  ranges, output dir, SED settings) is left untouched.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added

- **LightSAGE lightcone extraction flow in the Launch wizard.** A third guided
  flow, alongside SAGE26 setup and SAGEswarm: clone LightSAGE (upstream repo
  `sage-home/sage-lightcone`) → build *only* the `sage2kdtree` / `cli_lightcone`
  tools (SAGE itself is never rebuilt — ViSAGE feeds in your existing SAGE26
  output) → configure the two-stage pipeline → run it, streamed to the wizard
  terminal → **Visualize lightcone** launches straight into Lightcone Mode on
  the result. The macOS build step auto-detects an Apple-clang/SDK mismatch
  (Xcode's newest SDK ships libc++ headers newer LLVMs don't support) and
  falls back to a compatible installed SDK. All generated build/run scripts
  live under `~/.visage/`, never inside the third-party checkout. Reachable
  from the wizard menu ("LightSAGE") and a new toolbar button beside the
  SAGEswarm one. The produced lightcone is written to `<cwd>/sage_outputs/
  lightcone/` — ViSAGE's standard output folder, alongside screenshots,
  recordings, and exported catalogues.

- **Synthetic photometry (SED) for LightSAGE lightcones.** An optional third
  pipeline stage forward-models broadband AB magnitudes for every lightcone
  galaxy from its star-formation history, using
  [python-fsps](https://github.com/dfm/python-fsps) (`pip install
  "sage-viewer[sed]"`). Enabled via **SED_ENABLED** in the LightSAGE
  run-script parameter form, with a **SED_FRAME** choice (rest / observed /
  both) and a 14-checkbox, 2-column grid of individual filter bands (GALEX
  FUV/NUV, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, WISE W1-4 — UV/optical/NIR checked by
  default, WISE off by default since its mid-IR flux needs a dust model this
  pipeline doesn't have). Computes rest-frame (10 pc), observed-frame
  (luminosity-distance, K-corrected), or both, using the simulation's own
  cosmology rather than an assumed one. Results are written back into the
  lightcone HDF5 file as `mag_rest_<band>` / `mag_obs_<band>` datasets. When
  present, a new **Synthetic Photometry (SED)** section appears in the
  Structure panel (LightSAGE mode only) with a dedicated colour-by-band
  dropdown — every raw band, every derived colour index (e.g. g-r) between
  adjacent/broadest bands in a frame, and mass-to-light ratio for bands with
  a known solar magnitude — via the same colormap mechanism as every other
  property, with mode-appropriate default colormaps (diverging for colour
  indices, frame-distinct sequential for raw bands).
- **Wizard checkbox parameters render in a 2-column grid.** Any
  `*_ENABLED`-suffixed parameter-form field is now laid out half-width so
  consecutive checkboxes (like the new SED band picks) wrap into two columns
  instead of one long vertical list; text fields are unaffected (still
  full-width, one per row).

- **Lightcone Mode — the full Explore UI on a lightcone.** `visage --lightcone
  FILE` opens a `cli_lightcone` HDF5 output in the exact same toolbar,
  navigation panel, and info panel as a SAGE box — same gaussian-splat
  rendering, colour-by modes, and colormaps. Reads every SAGE field carried in
  the flat lightcone file into a full galaxy snapshot plus host haloes built
  from the `Type == 0` centrals. The snapshot slider becomes a redshift/time
  cut spanning only the snapshots present in the cone: moving it removes the
  near (lower-redshift) side, keeping the far side, with the full cone shown
  at the slider's maximum. Camera reset frames the cone horizontally, centred
  in the viewport.

- **Wizard parameter form.** Every editable config the wizard opens (SAGE26
  `.par`, SAGEswarm `run_pso.sh`, LightSAGE `run_lightcone.sh`) is now shown as
  a list of labelled boxes — one per option, pre-filled with its current value
  — instead of a raw text editor. Edits fold back into the file on Save & Run,
  preserving comments, quoting, and layout.

- **Session models.** The Launch-Mode dropdown now lists every box and
  lightcone opened so far in the session under **Session Models**, and
  clicking one jumps straight back to it. Persisted across relaunches in
  `~/.visage/session_models.json`, so switching from a lightcone to a box (or
  back) never loses track of what was open.

### Changed

- **No galaxy display cap.** Every galaxy passing the mass floor now loads —
  there's no benefit to downsampling since all snapshots are preloaded up
  front. `--max-galaxies` is removed from the CLI.

- **Flythrough tours groups and clusters continuously.** In both Explore and
  Lightcone Mode, flythrough no longer ends by zooming out to orbit the whole
  box/cone forever — it now keeps moving from one group/cluster to the next
  indefinitely. Reset Camera in Lightcone Mode now correctly reframes the
  cone (`Scene.is_lightcone`-aware) instead of using box-at-the-origin math.

- **Launch-wizard menu cleanup.** The hamburger dropdown's "EXPLORE MODE"
  heading is removed (the menu now serves both Explore and Lightcone Mode).
  "Start Fresh" moved to the end of the setup-choice list, and both
  "Switch to SAGE26 setup" buttons (in the SAGEswarm and LightSAGE flows) are
  now labelled "Back".

### Removed

- **FoF (friends-of-friends) satellite→central link lines.** The gold link
  overlay, its toggle button, and the underlying `fof_segments` data have been
  removed entirely. The separate FOF-*group* inspection features (Group Info
  panel, Highlight Members, environment classification) are unaffected.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-24

### Added

- **SAGEswarm calibration flow in the Launch wizard.** A new guided flow mirrors
  the SAGE26 setup path — clone SAGEswarm → `pip install -r requirements.txt` →
  pick the compiled `./sage` binary + `.par` → set constraints (`-x`) + output
  dir (`-o`) → run `python main.py …`, streamed to the wizard terminal. Reachable
  from the wizard menu ("SAGEswarm") and from a new toolbar button beside the
  Launch Mode button. The header step chips are now flow-aware (`wiz_steps`
  state var).
- **Live PSO plot gallery.** While a SAGEswarm run is in progress, ViSAGE watches
  the SAGEswarm main folder (the run's cwd) for `*.png` diagnostics and shows
  them in a dedicated, right-docked gallery panel that refreshes as plots appear
  or change (mtime-diffed, base64-inlined; server-side timer, no client polling).

### Changed

- **Rebrand: SAGE-Viewer is now ViSAGE.** The import package `sage_viewer`
  is renamed to `visage` and the CLI command `sage-viewer` becomes `visage`.
  GitHub URLs point to `MBradley1985/ViSAGE`. The PyPI distribution stays
  **`sage-viewer`** (`pip install sage-viewer`) — `visage`/`vi-sage` are blocked
  on PyPI by the existing `visage` project. This is a breaking change for anyone
  importing `sage_viewer` or invoking the old `sage-viewer` command.

- **Galaxy splats scale with the subhalo virial radius.** All galaxy layers
  (CGM/Hot outer envelope, cold-gas envelope, focus-only disk/bulge, and the
  Colour-by halo) are now sized by the galaxy's `Rvir` (read from the SAGE
  output; analytic Δ=200 fallback from Mvir where missing) instead of a fixed
  stellar-mass mapping. Most galaxies render tighter and less diffuse, while
  massive cluster centrals gain their true extent.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added

#### Story Mode — presentation playback over the live 3D view

A new **Story Mode** button (next to Fly-through) opens a dropdown of
*stories* — JSON files defining an ordered set of *scenes*, each a fully
captured viewer state (snapshot, camera, layer/filter/environment state,
focus) plus overlays and an optional camera motion — played back like slides
with Previous / Play / Pause / Next in a bottom HUD.

- **Discovery.** Stories load from `sage_stories/` in the launch directory
  (user stories, local-only) plus the examples bundled with the package
  (`sage_viewer/examples/`); a local story overrides a bundled one with the
  same title. Two examples ship: **Example Tour** (minimal) and
  **Presentation Template** (a full talk skeleton to copy and fill in).
- **Portable scenes.** Snapshots may be symbolic — `"first"`, `"last"`,
  `"40%"`, or a redshift like `"z=1.5"` — resolved against whatever model is
  loaded, and `camera: "box"` frames the box regardless of box size, so
  stories carry across outputs.
- **Motion.** Scenes can be `still`, `orbit`, `snapshot_sweep` (animate
  through cosmic time, with optional looping and pre-rendering during story
  load for instant playback), or `flythrough` (tour the massive structures;
  optional `rewind_to` plays a cached snapshot rewind back to a target
  redshift; `targets` can select galaxies instead of haloes; `style:
  "normal"` gives the calmer toolbar-style tour).
- **Overlays.** Titles, headings, body text, citations, LaTeX equations
  (vendored KaTeX under `static/katex/` — no network needed), images, videos,
  audio, and a clickable `scene_menu` grid of every scene. Overlays are
  authored on a fixed virtual stage that scales uniformly to fit any window,
  and media is served from `sage_viewer/static/` at `/sage_static/`.
- **Playback behaviour.** Story-level `autoplay` starts playback on entry;
  per-scene `hold` waits for Next instead of auto-advancing; scene changes
  are smoothed with a freeze-frame crossfade; per-scene `theme` and
  `chrome.hide_panel` give full-bleed presentation chrome. Scenes can declare
  a `models` layout (`primary` + `adjacent`); the pre-story layout, camera,
  state, and theme are restored on exit.
- **Sandbox preload.** Entering a story warms the snapshot cache for every
  snapshot the story references before the first scene renders.
- **Thumbnails.** A "Capture thumbnails" action screenshots every scene for
  the scene-menu grid.
- Camera moves reuse the shared `scene/camera_motion.py` helpers, which the
  Fly-through now also uses. Authoring guide: `docs/user_guide/story_mode.md`;
  design notes: `docs/project/story_mode_design.md`.

#### Library panel

- The Library panel sorts entries by file type with dividers, and supports
  multiple `sage_library` folders.

### Changed

- User stories in `sage_stories/` are no longer tracked in the repository —
  they stay local to the machine. Stories that should ship with the package
  belong in `sage_viewer/examples/`.
- The Story Mode HUD no longer shows a close cross, preventing accidental
  exits mid-presentation.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-25

> **Note:** the `1.2.0` artifact on PyPI was built from the wrong commit (the
> release tag pointed at a pre-release merge) and is missing the changes below.
> `1.2.1` is the first complete 1.2.x release. The `1.2.0` PyPI release has been
> yanked.

The following changes were intended for 1.2.0 and ship in 1.2.1:

### Changed

#### Pop-outs (terminal + library) resize freely, with a fullscreen toggle

The floating pop-out cards (console / terminal pop-out and library media items) could only
be shrunk, and growth was capped by `max-width` / `max-height` limits — the terminal hit a
~60% width wall and library cards couldn't widen past 540px or grow their media past `60vh`.

- **Removed the size caps.** Both card types are now `resize:both` with only small
  `min-width` / `min-height` floors, so they can be dragged to any size up to the viewport.
- **Library cards are flex columns** whose media (`<img>` / `<video>`) scales with
  `object-fit:contain` to fill the resized card, vertically as well as horizontally.
- **New fullscreen button** (`mdi-fullscreen`, beside the close button on each pop-out)
  toggles a `sage-popout-max` class that pins the card to fill the VTK render area; the glyph
  flips to `mdi-fullscreen-exit` and clicking again restores the previous size / position.
  Handled client-side in `sage_viewer.js` with the CSS in `sage_theme.css`.
- **Galaxy / Group info panels stay fixed-size but no longer squish in recordings.** The
  recording compositor (`_draw_info_panel`) drew labels left-aligned and values right-aligned
  at a fixed width, so long rows collided. It now measures each row and sizes the card to the
  widest `label + gap + value`, capped to the frame, so every field stays legible.
- **Static assets are cache-busted** (`?v=<mtime>` on `sage_viewer.js` / `sage_theme.css`)
  so client-side changes take effect on server restart instead of replaying a stale cached
  copy — this is why the fullscreen toggle initially appeared to do nothing.

#### Switching models now carries over the current view settings

Previously, switching the primary model (Models menu) reset the new model to its defaults:
snapshot jumped to z=0 and all filters, structure / colour modes, colormaps, opacities and
layer visibility reverted to factory values.  Now the full UI state transfers to the model
you switch to, and the settings apply to that model:

- **Filters, structure, colour modes, colormaps, opacities, layer visibility** are captured
  from the outgoing model and re-applied to the new one via the existing per-box profile
  machinery (`save_profile` / `load_profile`), with `state.dirty(*BOX_PROFILE_KEYS)` forcing
  every change handler to re-run against the new primary's layers.
- **Redshift (not raw snapshot index) is preserved.**  The outgoing model's current redshift
  is mapped onto the new model's snapshot list via `SnapshotTable.z_to_snap()` (closest
  match, clamped to range).  Models that share a snapshot list land on the identical snap;
  models with different lists (e.g. miniMillennium 64 snaps ↔ microUchuu 50 snaps) land on
  the snapshot closest in cosmic time rather than the same slider position.
- The new model's stored side-by-side profile (`_profiles[name]`) is updated to the carried
  state so a later Side-by-Side activation restores the same view.

### Fixed

#### Console commands — environment / type filters now do what they say

- **"show only clusters" (or any single class) now turns every other class off**,
  including pairs. Previously the "show only …" handler never touched the pairs
  flag, so pairs stayed visible.
- **"pair(s)" is its own class.** The parser mapped pairs into the isolated
  bucket, so "show only pairs" actually showed isolated. It now drives
  `env_show_pairs` correctly.
- **"show only centrals" / "show centrals" work.** A greedy "show only …" regex
  swallowed centrals/satellites (→ "unknown environment class"), and plain
  "show centrals" wasn't matched at all despite being documented. Both are fixed.

#### Terminal pop-out re-fits when resized

Resizing (or maximising) the console terminal pop-out grew the card but left the
xterm at its original size, so the terminal filled only part of the window. The
pop-out now attaches a `ResizeObserver` that calls the xterm `FitAddon` on every
resize (mirroring the wizard terminal), so the terminal always fills the card.

#### Recording — playback smoothness (root-cause investigation, two-session fix)

This section documents a chain of bugs that were introduced and resolved over two sessions.
The full causal chain is recorded here so it is not repeated.

**Stage 1 — original symptom:** Recording during snapshot playback was choppy because
`_record_loop` captured the pre-rendered overlay JPEGs and duplicated each 3 fps frame to
fill the 30 fps output.  Fix: dedicated VTK capture path reads directly from the render
window via `_vtk_to_pil()`.

**Stage 2 — double-play regression:** After the Stage 1 fix, recordings played through the
snapshot sequence twice when `is_repeat` was enabled.  Root cause: `_record_loop` followed
`state.snap_num`, which `_image_playback` loops indefinitely on repeat.  Fix: introduced
`_pb_order` — a one-pass list built from the starting snapshot to the last snapshot — and
`_pb_done` flag that stops capture after the list is exhausted.

**Stage 3 — live-recording slowdown:** With a 30 fps recording active, moving the camera on
a single snapshot (no playback) became sluggish.  Root cause: `_vtk_to_pil()` calls
`rw.SetOffScreenRendering(1)` + `rw.Render()` every recording tick, blocking the asyncio
event loop at 30 Hz and competing with interactive rendering.  Fix: added
`_vtk_to_pil_passive()`, which reads the last completed framebuffer via
`vtkWindowToImageFilter` with `ShouldRerenderOff()` / `ReadFrontBufferOff()` — no extra
`Render()` call.  Live recording with no rotation now uses the passive path; rotation and
snap changes still use `_vtk_to_pil()`.

**Stage 4 — rotation double-step:** Both `_rotate_loop` (toolbar.py, 12 Hz) and
`_record_loop` applied a camera rotation per tick.  Result: rotation rate doubled during
recording.  Fix: `_rotate_loop` checks `state.recording_active` at each tick and skips both
the rotation step and the `_push()` call when True.  The recording loop owns all camera
movement while a recording is active; `_rotate_loop` resumes ownership when recording stops.

**Stage 5 — playback smoothness regression (this session):** After Stage 2–4, playback
recordings were choppy again at any FPS.  Root cause had two independent components:

- *Pre-render phase interference:* `playback_active=True` is set by `_render_frames()` as
  soon as the first frame is pre-rendered, which is well before `_image_playback()` starts.
  Because `_record_loop` started its `_pb_order` pass the moment it saw
  `playback_active=True`, `_pb_idx` advanced through 10–30 snaps during the pre-render
  phase (several seconds at 30 fps).  When `_image_playback` finally started, recording
  was already deep into the sequence and the camera angles were mismatched (pre-render
  restores the camera to its starting position at the end; recording had already baked in
  extra rotation from the pre-render window).

- *PIL caching eliminated VTK temporal variation:* The Stage 3 optimisation cached the raw
  PIL image for frames where neither snap nor rotation changed (up to 9 out of every 10
  frames at 1× speed without rotation).  VTK's MSAA jitter produces subtly different renders
  on successive `Render()` calls for the same scene; caching the PIL bypassed this and
  produced runs of byte-identical frames that the human eye perceives as harder / choppier
  than renders with natural inter-frame variation.

  **Final fix:** Replaced `_pb_order` with overlay-driven `state.snap_num` tracking plus a
  `prerender_busy` guard that holds capture until `_image_playback()` is actually running.
  Removed all PIL caching in the playback path; every recording frame now calls
  `_vtk_to_pil()` (force render).  One-pass detection uses end-snap rollover: when
  `state.snap_num` reaches `_pb_end_snap` the `_pb_at_end` flag is set; when `snap_num`
  subsequently changes away from the end snap (repeat wrap-around), `_pb_done` is set and
  capture stops.  `is_repeat=False` (default) still terminates naturally when
  `playback_active` goes False.

**Key invariant for future work:** `playback_active=True` does NOT mean `_image_playback()`
is running — it is also True during `_render_frames()` pre-render.  Always gate playback
recording on `prerender_busy=False`.

#### Recording — reset camera not showing all structure

`on_reset()` called `scene.camera.focus_on_boxes()` then `_sync_fof_layer()`, which
shows/hides FoF-link actors.  `scene.plotter.renderer.ResetCameraClippingRange()` was called
before the visibility change, so near/far clipping planes were computed against the wrong
actor set and some geometry was clipped out of view.  Fix: moved
`ResetCameraClippingRange()` to after `_sync_fof_layer()`.

#### Recording — galaxy/group info card absent from output frames

The Galaxy Information and Group Information overlay cards were being composited during
screenshots but not during recording.  Root cause: `_composite_overlays()` was accidentally
dropped from `_save_frame()` during a `_record_loop` refactor.  Fix: re-added
`_composite_overlays(raw).save(...)` as the final step of `_save_frame()` so every captured
frame, regardless of recording mode, has the same overlay compositing as a screenshot.

Note: highlight markers (Highlight Galaxy / Highlight Members) are baked into the
pre-rendered frames via `_render_frames()` and are therefore always present in recordings.
Info cards are composited separately from current `state` at capture time.

#### Launch Mode terminal — persistent 1-row sliver (root-cause investigation)

Three successive fixes were required before the sliver was eliminated.  The full history is
recorded here to avoid re-treading the same ground.

**Attempt 1 — height guard:** `_initWizTerm()` polled until `container.offsetWidth > 0` but
did not check height.  In the VCard's `display:flex;flex-direction:column` layout, height
resolves after width, so the poll could pass with `offsetHeight=0`.  `fitAddon.fit()` then
called `getComputedStyle(container).height` → "0px" → 0 rows → 1-row sliver.
Fix: added `container.offsetHeight < 50` to the poll condition.

**Attempt 2 — requestAnimationFrame:** Even with the height guard passing (container had a
real height), the sliver reappeared after server hot-restarts.  Root cause: `fitAddon.fit()`
was called synchronously after `term.open()`, before xterm.js had completed its first
browser paint cycle and measured character cell dimensions (`actualCellHeight` was 0).
`fitAddon.proposeDimensions()` returns `undefined` when cell height is 0; `fit()` silently
no-ops; the terminal keeps its default 1-row height.  Fix: moved the first `fit()` call into
a `requestAnimationFrame` callback (after the initial paint) with 150 ms and 500 ms deferred
re-fits as insurance.

**Attempt 3 — CSS grid (final fix):** The sliver persisted through Attempt 2 because the
root cause was not timing but layout: `display:flex;flex-direction:column` with `flex:1` on
the terminal div does not always produce a pixel height readable by `getComputedStyle()` at
the moment xterm.js needs it — the browser may report `height:auto` for flex children under
certain conditions.  `fitAddon.proposeDimensions()` calls `parseInt(height)` on that value,
which returns `NaN`, causing `fit()` to bail silently.

  **Final fix:** Changed the VCard from `display:flex;flex-direction:column` to
  `display:grid;grid-template-rows:1fr auto`.  The terminal div occupies the `1fr` row and
  the action bar occupies the `auto` row.  CSS grid always resolves grid track sizes to
  explicit pixel values before layout completes — `getComputedStyle(terminal).height` is
  always a number, never `"auto"`.  `fitAddon.fit()` reliably reads the correct height
  regardless of when it is called.  The `offsetHeight < 50` poll guard and
  `requestAnimationFrame` deferral are retained as belt-and-suspenders.

  **Rule for future layout changes in the Launch Mode card:** the terminal container
  (`sage-wiz-pty`) must always sit in a CSS context that resolves its height to an explicit
  pixel value — grid `1fr`, absolute with known `top`/`bottom`, or an explicit `height:`.
  Do not use `flex:1;min-height:0` as the sole height source for an xterm.js container.

#### Recording — finalization silently abandoned after stop

Stopping a recording produced a frames folder full of images but no output file (GIF / MOV /
PNG sequence).  Root cause: the finalization daemon thread (`_do_finalize`) had no top-level
exception handler.  Any error inside `_finalize_movie` — including the completely unguarded
`_expand_with_crossfade` call that expands playback snap files into the crossfaded frame
sequence — would kill the thread silently, leaving `state.last_movie` stuck at `"Encoding…"`
and the frames folder on disk with no assembled output.

Fix: wrapped the `_finalize_movie` call in `_do_finalize` with a `try/except` so any
failure is reported in the Record tab's "Last:" label.  Also wrapped the
`_expand_with_crossfade` call inside `_finalize_movie` with its own `try/except` so errors
from that stage surface as a readable error string rather than an uncaught exception.

#### Coords / Box tabs — Clear button now clears indicator and undoes focus

The **Clear** button in the Coords and Box tabs previously only appeared while a Draw Sphere
or Draw Box widget was actively being placed, and only removed the interactive handles — it
did not clear the grey wireframe indicator left by the Zoom operation, and did not undo the
focus region.

Fix:
- `on_clear_draw_sphere` / `on_clear_draw_box` now also call
  `scene.camera._clear_indicator()`, `scene.clear_focus()`, `state.focus_active = False`,
  and `_sync_fof_layer()`, fully reversing a Zoom + Focus action in one click.
- The Clear button visibility condition changed from `draw_sphere_active` /
  `draw_box_active` to `draw_sphere_active || focus_active` (and equivalent for box), so the
  button appears as soon as a zoom is committed — not only during active drawing.

#### Coords / Box — Reset Camera left zoom indicator wireframe on screen

Pressing **Reset Camera** after zooming to a sphere or box region left the grey wireframe
indicator actor on screen.  Root cause: `on_reset` called `_clear_draw_widgets()` (which
removes the interactive cyan draw handles) but never called
`scene.camera._clear_indicator()`, which is the separate actor placed by `zoom_to_radius()`
/ `zoom_to_box()`.  Fix: one `scene.camera._clear_indicator()` call added to `on_reset`
immediately after `_clear_draw_widgets()`.

#### Library — GIF animations started mid-way instead of from frame 0

Opening a GIF in the Library viewer showed the animation already several frames in rather
than starting from the beginning.  Root cause: the browser starts decoding and playing a GIF
as soon as the `<img>` src attribute is set, but the Vue render cycle and DOM compositing
(backdrop-filter, elevation shadow) mean the card is not visible to the user until 1–2
animation frames later.  For a 10 fps GIF, one frame is 100 ms — already past the start.

Fix: added a `MutationObserver` in `sage_viewer.js` that watches for new `<img>` elements
inside `.sage-popout` cards.  When a GIF `<img>` is detected, the observer waits two
`requestAnimationFrame` callbacks (allowing the card to be painted), then synchronously
resets `img.src = ''` followed by `img.src = originalSrc` in the same JavaScript event.
Both assignments are synchronous so no blank frame is visible; the GIF animation restarts
from frame 0 exactly when the card becomes visible to the user.

## [1.0.9] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- GIF recordings no longer show visible contour lines around gaussian splat points — switched from `imageio` (no dithering) to PIL's native GIF writer with Floyd-Steinberg dithering, which distributes colour quantisation error across neighbouring pixels and produces smooth gradients instead of hard bands

---

## [1.0.8] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Galaxy Info and Group Info panels now appear in screenshots and recordings** — the info card is composited as a PIL overlay (matching its on-screen position at top-right) whenever it is visible at capture time, same technique already used for the console pop-out and library cards
- **Highlight actors (Highlight Galaxy / Highlight Members) now appear in playback recordings** — the pre-rendered frame cache is invalidated whenever the indicator state changes, so pressing Play after adding highlights always re-renders with them included

### Fixed

- Screenshots taken while **not** in playback no longer use a stale pre-rendered JPEG from a previous playback session; they always capture the live VTK render window

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Library tab now scans `sage_library/` and `sage_outputs/` relative to the **working directory** instead of the package install location — items are found correctly when installed via `pip`
- `sage_library/` folder is created in the working directory on startup (alongside `sage_outputs/`)
- `./sage-viewer` launcher now finds whichever Python version has `trame` installed, instead of assuming the shell's default `python3` — fixes failures on macOS where multiple Python versions coexist

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Screenshots, recordings, GIFs, and catalogue exports now save to a `sage_outputs/` folder in the **current working directory** rather than inside the Python package installation (a `site-packages` subfolder), which made them inaccessible when installed via `pip`
- `.par` template no longer contains hardcoded personal paths — `OutputDir`, `SimulationDir`, and `FileWithSnapList` are now filled in dynamically from the detected or cloned SAGE26 directory
- README: replaced 47 MB and 13 MB embedded GIFs (which overran PyPI's image proxy) with text links to the animated demos on GitHub

### Added

- Launch Mode wizard: **Clone SAGE26** step now prompts for the parent directory (defaults to home folder) before cloning, so pip-installed users can choose where SAGE26 lands rather than having it hardcoded relative to CWD

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Launch Mode: clicking **×** to close now properly stops the server (`asyncio.ensure_future` instead of bare `await` in sync handler, which caused a `RuntimeWarning: coroutine was never awaited` and left the process running)

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Launch Mode: **×** button now calls `server.stop()` to shut down the process when running standalone; previously it only hid the wizard UI without terminating the server

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- GIF frames resized to canonical resolution when a mixed native/supersampled frame arrives mid-recording — prevents dimension mismatch crash
- `scipy` added to declared package dependencies (was used but omitted from `pyproject.toml`, breaking `pip install` environments)
- CI: `libgl1-mesa-glx` → `libgl1` (package renamed in Ubuntu 22+)
- CI: removed invalid `W503` ruff selector; added intentional-style codes (`E402`, `E701`, `E702`, `E401`, `C408`) to ignore list; auto-fixed `UP037`/`UP035` quoted annotations and deprecated `Callable` import
- Docs URL updated from readthedocs.io to GitHub Pages (`mbradley1985.github.io/SAGE-Viewer`)
- README image paths changed to absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs so images render on PyPI

### Added

- GitHub Actions publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) — builds wheel + sdist and publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing on every `v*` tag push; no API token needed in CI
- Docs pages: Multi-Box Comparison, Launch Mode, Recording, Library (all new)
- `docs/mkdocs.yml` nav updated with new pages

### Changed

- `docs/getting_started/installation.md`: removed broken `pip install sage-viewer` section; HPC section updated to use `install_hpc.sh` instead of conda
- `docs/getting_started/quickstart.md`: fixed "left panel" → Structure tab (right panel); "click" → double-click
- `docs/user_guide/console.md`: rewrote Terminal mode to reflect PTY backend; removed stale "no pty" limitations section
- `docs/user_guide/interface.md`: seven tabs → nine tabs; added Console and Library rows; added Multi-Box Strip section

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-22

First public release on PyPI.

### Added

#### HPC install script (`install_hpc.sh`)
- Creates a Python venv and pip-installs SAGE-Viewer in editable mode in one step
- Checks Python ≥ 3.10; accepts optional positional argument for venv path on scratch filesystems
- Checks for `ffmpeg` separately and prints a `module load ffmpeg` hint if absent

#### Side-by-side multi-box comparison
- Load two or more SAGE models side-by-side via `+SBS` in the hamburger Models section
- Each box is fully independent: snapshot, filters, colormaps, opacity, layer visibility
- Box strip at the bottom of the viewport; clicking a box makes it active (green label)
- Play, step, and snapshot slider advance only the active box's snapshot
- Halo Mvir colour mode locked to Viridis for visual consistency across boxes
- Background snapshot preloading and per-snapshot KDTree pre-building

#### Launch Mode wizard (`sage_viewer/wizard/`)
- Guided setup flow for configuring and launching SAGE26
- Step chips in the header track progress (cyan = current, green = done, white = pending)
- **Rescan** button restarts the environment scan at any point
- **Create config file** option writes a new `.par` from the built-in template
- Par file editor opens side-by-side with the terminal for simultaneous editing and output review
- SAGE26 `OutputDir` is created automatically before the binary runs
- Wizard always resets cleanly when re-opened from Explore Mode

#### PTY-backed xterm.js terminal (Console tab)
- Terminal mode replaced with a real PTY (`pty.openpty()`) — full ANSI colour, cursor control, interactive programs (`vim`, `top`, `htop`, `less`) all work
- PTY sessions cleaned up automatically on app exit via `atexit` handler
- Multiple sessions, each with their own PTY process, history, mode, cwd, env, and Python interpreter

#### Interactive draw widgets — Coords and Box tabs
- **Draw Sphere**: two draggable handle balls (centre + edge) with live field updates; **Lock Sphere** commits as the active focus region
- **Draw Box**: native `vtkBoxWidget2` with face and corner handles; **Lock Box** commits; **Clear** cancels without navigating
- Both widgets centre on the camera focal point when first placed; cleared automatically on Reset Camera and model switch

#### Library pop-out improvements
- Multiple items open simultaneously as independent floating cards with diagonal cascade positioning
- GIF always restarts from frame 0 on open (unique `#N` URL fragment busts browser animation cache)
- Close reliability fixed: authoritative Python list as source of truth instead of reading stale Trame proxy state

#### Movie recording fixes
- FPS now honoured: frame written every `1/fps` seconds, reusing cached image when playback frame hasn't changed
- Encoding offloaded to a daemon thread so UI stays responsive during GIF/MOV assembly
- Intermediate frames saved as JPEG quality 95 (~10 ms/frame) instead of PNG (~100 ms/frame)
- Minimum 1 ms sleep per tick prevents event-loop starvation when frame capture exceeds `1/fps`

### Fixed

#### Launch Mode wizard
- **Back navigation**: clicking Back from any downstream step (run SAGE26, par edit, compile failure) now correctly returns to the main menu instead of the Start Fresh submenu
- UI text: "Edit the file below" → "Edit the file to the right" (par editor is side-by-side); "Running SAGE26 — output streams below" → "Running SAGE26 — output follows"
- Layout: terminal card `max-width` dynamic (1100 px solo, 860 px with par editor); choice buttons scroll within `max-height:120px`; buttons shrink to `x-small` when more than 5 choices
- xterm.js CDN entries and `wiz_active` state initialisation fixed — terminal was blank on launch via `./sage-viewer` with no `--par` flag

#### Draw Box / Draw Sphere widget placement
- Both widgets now appear centred on the camera focal point at field-of-view-appropriate size
- Box widget handles restored to constant size after each drag via `EndInteractionEvent` observer

#### Double-click galaxy selection accuracy
- Two-stage selection: find 50 nearest galaxies in 3D (KDTree), then project to screen and pick the visually closest
- Respects environment checkbox state and `_combined_mask()` so only visible galaxies are selectable

#### Trame / rendering
- `view_update()` called after `plotter.render()` in box-switch and toggle handlers so new frames reach the browser immediately
- FoF satellite→central links respect active halo filter mask, focus region, and halos-visible toggle
- Playback frame cache keyed on a `_scene_hash()` covering all filter, visibility, colormap, and focus state — cached frames never replayed after scene changes

---

## [0.3.0]

### Added

#### Embedded shell console
- Real shell via `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell`; globs, pipes, redirects, backgrounding all work
- `cd`, `pwd`, `export` handled as in-process built-ins

#### Tab-aware Focus button
- Focuses on whatever is active in the current tab (target galaxy, environment halo, coords point, or box region)

#### Dynamic colour-by dropdowns
- Only modes whose underlying field is present in the loaded model appear; rebuild automatically on model switch

#### Library tab — per-row delete
- Red trash button permanently removes the file from disk and refreshes the list immediately

#### Filter active-only architecture
- Filters only take effect when moved from full-range defaults; all galaxies visible at startup

#### Double-click everywhere
- Picker globally on; double-click populates Target tab fields and draws the red marker

#### Switching-models overlay
- Cyan-bordered overlay covers the viewport while a model is loading; rotating quip shows server is alive

### Changed
- Toolbar re-arranged: hamburger left, transport + controls right
- Right panel locked at 300 px, never scrolls
- Indicators persist across tab switches
- Structure mode simplified to three layers (outer envelope, cold-gas envelope, property shell)
- All Unicode super/subscripts replaced with ASCII across user-visible strings
- Full still-quality rendering at all times (no interactive quality reduction)

### Fixed
- Galaxy filters silently excluding low-mass galaxies — active-only architecture resolves this
- Double-click could select invisible (filtered / out-of-focus) galaxies
- Snapshot-slider crash when focus mask and filter mask have different lengths after snapshot change
- Pop-out console now actually draggable (static asset replaces inline `<script>` stripped by Vue 3)
- FoF links hidden for halos that don't pass active filters or focus region

---

#### Record tab
- Screenshots (PNG / JPG / TIFF); movies (GIF / MOV / PNG sequence)
- FPS slider, resolution selector (Native / 2× / 4×), per-session output folder

#### Camera
- Centre button; Camera bookmarks (save, restore, delete)

### Self-contained HDF5 metadata
- Cosmology, box size, and snapshot redshifts read from `model_0.hdf5` — `.par` file only needed for tree paths

### Rendering overhaul
- World-space gaussian splats (`vtkPointGaussianMapper`) with per-point `radius` array
- In-place PolyData updates across snapshot transitions
